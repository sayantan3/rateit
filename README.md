Simple movie information system.

TODO:
 1. Retrive movie info from imdb. 
 2. Using knapsack find the weightage of movie time/rating.
 3. Return watch worthyness.

Using knapsack relevent here because it ia a combinatorial optimization problem.
-> The combination of time and rating is important intially to find the value of worthyness.
