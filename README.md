First movie -> scrape date from imdb (check possibility / legality)
later rotten tomato
Movie -> time -> rating -> worth to watch / time || unrated 

future scope::
Youtube -> type -> people's rating -> worth to watch  [need real critic for that/and popular openion too]
Game -> quality/story/supportability 
quality = (fun + involving + seemlessness) / 3
